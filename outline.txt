Web app:
Stores queue of players
Does keyword search
Gets batch of images back
Web app runs on same machine as Processing app

Status app
Polls for state of game
(being played, list of players, etc)


Web app:
Log in
Do keyword search
Listing IDs

what processing needs:
listing ids, tags, and 


Game states:
Game is not being played
Game has been begun (initial search is done)
Round is up but not selected
Round is completed (item was selected, added to treasury)
Game over, scoring


Processing: 
SimpleML

SO.

Web interface that submits name, search query also kicks off sourcefile generation script

Result: source file of [listingIDs, tempIDs, urls]


Initialize 1st group of images in Processing
	- load from source file



* Draw images on the canvas

	//Curl images to data directory on sketch reset

	Clicker (basic interactivity wireup) :
	make array of sequential values to simulate position hits
	
	
	when you click (signal a certain position hit)
		print the ID that you're adding
->		add the ID to an output array? or just call the script to add the item to the treasury (build up one by one, so that if one call fails that's ok)
			need to know id of current input, map to collection of ListingImage objects
				get it from random number generator for the moment
		
		* update the list of images to render

		* undraw all the images and get a new set of images 
	
	
		
	
	
	
	
	the image identifier should be added to a "selected" bucket
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	later: need image object that stores image URL and Etsy tags
		// images are 
		decrement "remaining successful hits" in order to populate a new group of images
		click positions (input values) 
		
		[ 0, 1, 2 ] (size equals number of input pillows)
		
	
	When position-hit bucket is exhausted 
	
	Processing reads { image filenames, listing IDs } from a resource file created for the currently selected keyword 
	Processing creates an output file with listing IDs
	When output file is at 12 
	
	Player queue: login; session
	Look at how to create treasuries with Etsy API
	Write script that 
	
	
Draw images from Etsy API
	// filesystem bullshit that can happen later
	
	load (how many?) based on tag search into a buffer directory
	copy small batch from buffer
